Theme : Heritage and Culture

Idea : Creating a app for tamil nadu based on culture and history.


Problem Statement: 
The existing application suffers from numerous shortcomings.
It lacks a comprehensive historical overview, neglecting to highlight significant nostalgic places within districts. 
Additionally, it fails to provide insights into local cultures, traditions, games, dances, music, and musical instruments.
Users encounter difficulty contacting sellers of traditional items and struggle to locate historical sites with detailed information about their significance. 
The absence of audio and visual formats for sharing information further diminishes its appeal. 
Moreover,A Place will be remembered better by the taste of good food but the app lacks detailed information about the culinary delights, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, specific to each region. 
It overlooks special occasions and festivals unique to different places. 
The app also fails to provide a holistic understanding of all these aspects in a single platform. 
It lacks information about local crops and harvesting cultures.

Solution :  Our proposed application aims to address these shortcomings comprehensively, providing users with a rich and immersiveÂ experience.
